Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our Terms. The use of information collected through our Sites shall be limited to the purposes under this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service to customers.<div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Information We Collect:</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; (a) Our Service: We may collect personally identifiable information about you, such as your full name, phone number, email address, or similar, when you register for a specific event or for our email list. If you choose to purchase a service from us, we or any third-party payment processors will collect your payment information.

If you no longer wish to receive our emails, you may opt out of them by <a href="http://trondheimmeditasjon.us2.list-manage.com/unsubscribe?u=d88f27c253d243b4b85912640&id=7b09181118" target="_blank">going to this link.</a></div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; (b) Cookies And Tracking Technologies: Technologies such as: cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by TMY and our partners (such as advertising, marketing and analytics), affiliates or analytics or service providers. These technologies may be used in analyzing trends, administering the Sites, tracking users’ movements around the Sites and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by such companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis. Our partners may also use such technologies to deliver advertisements to you. We use cookies to remember users’ settings as well as for authentication and analytics. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our Sites, but your ability to use some features or areas of our Sites may be limited. If you are located in Europe, your IP address and personal information are never stored or shared with any third-parties. We process and keep all data for our own website within Europe and, if you wish to opt-out from tracking by TMY, you can do so by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@tmy.no">privacy@tmy.no</a>. We also use Google Analytics. Some or all of these tools may be used to track information about your behavior on our website depending on your region. For more information or to opt-out, please visit the respective website(s) of these vendors or contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@tmy.no">privacy@tmy.no</a>.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; (c) Log File Information: Log file information is automatically reported by your browser or mobile application each time you access our Sites or the TMY Service. For example, when you access our Sites or the TMY Service, our servers automatically record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website. These server logs may include information such as your operating system, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and other such information. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; (d) Access And Retention Of Data Controlled By Our Customers: An individual who is currently or has been on the TMY email list or has given us their personal information through sign up for an event or similar, who seeks access or wishes to correct, amend or delete inaccurate data should direct his query to <a href="mailto:privacy@tmy.no">privacy@tmy.no</a>. If we receive a request under this provision, we will acknowledge it within seventy-two (72) business hours and handle it promptly and as required by law.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; TMY will retain this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; How We Use Your Information.

We may store personal information in locations outside the direct control of TMY (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers). Any personally identifiable information you elect to make publicly available on our Sites or the TMY, such as posting comments on our social media pages, will be available to others. If you remove information that you have made public on our Sites or the TMY Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of our Sites or the TMY Service, or if other users have copied or saved that information. You will need to contact or login into any third party application if you want the personal information that was posted to the comments section removed. To learn how the third party application uses your information, please review their privacy policy.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; (b) Non-Personally Identifiable Information: We may share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to help them understand the usage patterns for certain TMY Services and those of our partners. Such results consist solely of non-personally identifiable information. If you remove information that you have made public on the Mouseflow Service or Site, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Mouseflow Service or Site, or if other users have copied or saved that information. Non-personally identifiable information may be stored indefinitely.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; (c) Instances Where We Are Required To Share Your Information: Mouseflow will disclose your information where required to do so by law, if subject to subpoena or other legal proceeding or if we reasonably believe that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement; (b) to enforce our Terms of Service or to protect the security or integrity of our Service; and/or (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Mouseflow, our users or others.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; (d) What Happens In The Event Of A Change Of Control: We may buy or sell/divest/transfer the company (including any shares in the company), or any combination of its products, services, assets and/or businesses.

With your consent, we may post your testimonial along with your name. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at privacy@mouseflow.com.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Storage and Processing. Your information collected through the Mouseflow Service may be stored and processed in the United States, Europe, or any other country in which Mouseflow or its subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities. Mouseflow may transfer information that we collect about you, including personal information, to affiliated entities, or to other third parties across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world.

Mouseflow is concerned with protecting your privacy and data, but we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Mouseflow or guarantee that your information on the Mouseflow Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of any of our industry standard physical, technical or managerial safeguards. When you enter sensitive information (such as log in credentials) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). No method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Site, you can contact us at privacy@mouseflow.com We use an outside help platform, and a credit card processing company to bill you if you purchase services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Privacy Shield. Mouseflow self-certifies compliance with EU-US Privacy Shield at the U.S. Department of Commerce.

Mouseflow has certified that it adheres to the requirements of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access and enforcement.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; GDPR. Please review our dedicated page to learn more about our approach to GDPR.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Compromise of Personal Information. In the event that personal information is compromised as a breach of security, Mouseflow will promptly notify our customers in compliance with applicable law.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Data Access, Correction, Deletion, and Opt Out. For current Mouseflow customers, you can review, correct, update or delete inaccuracies to the information about you that Mouseflow keeps on file by logging into your account to update your password and billing information. Alternately (for data subjects tracked by Mouseflow and for former Mouseflow customers), you can contact us directly at privacy@mouseflow.com. We will acknowledge your request within seventy-two (72) hours and handle it promptly and as required by law. We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements. If you wish to opt-out of being tracked by Mouseflow's analytics software, you can do so at https://mouseflow.com/opt-out/.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Children’s Privacy. Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, Mouseflow does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13.
